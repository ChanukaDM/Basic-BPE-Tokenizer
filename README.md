# Basic BPE Tokenizer

This repository contains a simple **Basic Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer** built from scratch.  
It demonstrates how tokenizers for transformers work at a fundamental level â€” from text preprocessing and vocabulary building to token merging.  

The goal of this project is to provide an educational, minimal implementation of a tokenizer without relying on external libraries, making it easier to understand the inner workings of modern NLP pipelines.
